# smdev + elogind seat management

This gets the [Artix implementation of smdev](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/smdev) to notify elogind of devices which should be accessible to logged in, non-root users.

Thankfully, it seems (e)logind does not need libudev's tag enumeration to be notified of devices with uaccess, but rather, a helper program located in /usr/lib. By making smdev call this program, we can make access to many devices Just Workâ„¢ without the user having to add themselves to groups audio, video and input.

See the first line of the script for usage. Also, editing the last line of the script, any seat manager with a similar arrangement can be made to work.
